# TENT

Thank you for your interest in our work!

This is the code for KDD2022 paper Task-Adaptive Few-shot Node Classification.


### Code Running
To run the code:

First, unzip the dataset file by running the command:

`unzip dataset.zip`

Due to the large size of ogbn-arxiv, it will be automatically downloaded when you run the code for the first time.
Then run the command:

`python train_TENT.py`

The datasets and parameters can be tuned in the same file. And the results will be recorded as a json file in the same directory.
